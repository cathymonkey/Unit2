## Task 3: Learning about your client
### Consider also the previous Matrix. The following is the description of the problem as described by the student that created it 2 years ago:###

### ‚ÄúCurrently, every time students go off-campus we have to sign out by filling out a Google Form. We specify our return date, destination, and other details. When we return back from our outing we sign in by checking our name out of a list of  signed-out people. The form is long (it has around 8 questions), it does not have any default input values (such as the date or destination), and many times the data is the same or unique for each user, for example, the house to which they belong to or their mobile phone. The ‚Äúovernight‚Äù checkbox is another example of an unnecessary question: this can be calculated by parsingthe input return ate.‚Äù

### 1. What is the context in which the original Matrix system was designed?
  * How big did the Matrix system need to be? 
  * What features were needed?
  * Who were the intended users of the system?



### 2. What are some issues that could arise when transitioning from the old sign in/out system based on Google Forms to the dedicated web application Matrix? 


### 3. What would be the advantages and limitations of hosting the Matrix on a local computer versus on the cloud?




### 4. Describe how would a Direct changeover, Parallel run, an ad phased implementation look like for the Matrix system? 



#### 5. What would be the consequences of a deficient transition from the old Google Form system to the Matrix, and to the New Matrix Reloaded? What would be the consequences of data loss?




### 6.[HL]
**üìîA book shop has a computer at each point of sale, and also a central computer. When a customer buys a book in the book shop, the salesperson at the point of sale uses a scanning device to input a barcode from the book. The barcode is sent to the central computer where the barcode of each book and the corresponding price are held in a database on a disk. When the price is found, it is sent to the point of sale computer where all necessary calculations are performed, details of the transaction are stored on a local disk and a receipt is printed out.

### a) Construct a system flow chart for the system described above.



### At the point of sale there are peripheral devices other than the scanning device and printer.





### b) Define peripheral devices


### c)Outline the purpose of one other possible peripheral device in this scenario.


### The customers can also buy books online. A customer can select a book, and then enter their name, address and credit card number. This data is stored on the book shop‚Äôs central computer in a database of customer orders.

### d) Identify two sources of risk to personal data in this online system.


### e) State two measures that the book shop can take to address the risks identified in part (d).



### f) Outline the consequences to the customer if their data is not adequately protected.
